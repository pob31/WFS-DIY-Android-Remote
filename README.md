This is a remote control for WFS-DIY version 3 only. It will not work with version 2 for which there is a Lemur template for you to adapt.
It should run on most versions of Android. If you find any bugs please report them: contact@pixetbel.org
The layout for phones will come eventually. Most of it should be okay for now except the Input Parameters tab which needs to be adapted to smaller screens.

Before you ask, I have no plans for an iOS version. It would cost 200€ a year to cover the costs of releasing an app for iOS (100€/y for the Apple Developer program and 100€/y for each app on the App Store with the certainty they will break stuff with each OS release...) Unless you want to start a crowdfunding for it and are okay to sponsor the development tools and the time, don't hold your breath. You iPad will work very well with the console remote app or the QLab remote. There are large inexpensive Android tablets, new and used. ;)
Thank you for your understanding.
